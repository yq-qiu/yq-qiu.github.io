All eukaryotic cells contain a cytoskeleton. A major component of the cytoskeleton is actin, a semi-
flexible biopolymer that can assemble and disassemble. Actin collaborates with various molecular motors
and accessory proteins to regulate the mechanical properties of cells and contribute to diverse cell functions, such as their structural integrity, motility, and signaling. 

We aim to derive a predictive framework
to elucidate how the organization and activity of the cytoskeleton arise from the mechanics, dynamics,
and cooperative interactions of individual components. 

Although direct in vivo measurement and imaging
and in vitro reconstruction of cytoskeletal networks provide many extraordinary insights into the physical control principles of their adaptive behavior, new non-equilibrium theory frameworks, together
with computational methods including advanced machine learning techniques are required to
interpret the measurements and simulations and integrate the findings from different approaches to build
predictive theoretical descriptions.
